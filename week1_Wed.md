## Notes

This is like microsoft word; intention is for notes
.md is "markdown file"

"Commit changes..." = saving the file (on github)

To write code, utilize: (''') `(insert language) (''') but the other tick not this one (where the tilde is)

## How to store code in markdown file
```java

public class HelloWorld {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
  // TODO: study this for Java Basics

  // this is a comment

  /*
  this is also
  a comment
  */

  System.out.println("Hello World"); // print to screen (console)
  }
}

```
